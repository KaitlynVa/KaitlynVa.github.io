    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Kaitlyn grew up in Celina, Texas and graduated from Baylor University with BAs in Mathematics and Slavic and East European Studies. She commissioned 
        as an Air Force 2nd Lt from Baylor's Detachment 810 and is currently completing her MS in Data Science for Public Policy 
        with a Certificate in Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies at Georgetown University. She is a 2021 Critical Language Scholar for Azerbaijani
        (virtual study in Baku) and 2025 CLS Refresh Fellow, studied abroad in Kyrgyzstan as a 2022 Project Global Officer Scholar for Russian, spent a 
        semester studying in Slovakia, and was selected as a Harry S. Truman Scholar in 2023 (Texas).
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Grounded in her academic and linguistic training in Slavic, Central Asian, and Caucasus studies, Kaitlyn’s policy interests focus on U.S. foreign policy, 
        Eurasian politics, and the dynamics of non-alignment and state strategy in post-Soviet spaces. She is particularly motivated by questions of conflict, 
        identity, and governance, as well as how international institutions respond to fragile or contested political environments. She intends to leverage causal 
        inference, econometric designs, and machine-learning methods to inform public sector decision making on issues such as national security, conflict response, 
        and U.S. engagement abroad.
